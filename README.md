DURATION:6 WEEKS

The objective of this task is to build a real-time chat application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, supported by a Node.js backend and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The application allows multiple users to send and receive messages instantly through a web interface. This chat system mimics the core functionality of common messaging platforms, providing a simple and responsive UI for users to interact.
The frontend is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It consists of a chat window that displays messages and an input field for users to type and send messages. Socket.IO is used on both client and server sides to enable bi-directional communication between users in real time.
The backend is created with Node.js and Express to serve static files and manage WebSocket connections. When a user sends a message, it is emitted to the server using Socket.IO, which then broadcasts it to all connected clients, ensuring real-time updates across all user interfaces.
This project demonstrates core concepts of event-driven programming, server-client communication, and real-time web applications. It serves as a foundational exercise for understanding how modern chat systems and live applications operate on the web.
